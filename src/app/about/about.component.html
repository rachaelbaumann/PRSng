      We are the Fall 2018 Java Bootcamp at MAX Technical Training/Cincy Code IT. 
      Our class is called 'Dev Jam', we are fourteen people who come from all walks of life with 
      many different backgrounds. Despite all this, we have managed to come together and be friends.
      During the bootcamp, we met nearly every weekend to work on our new skills or study together.
      Thanks to the tireless efforts of our instructors Sean Blessing and Greg Doud, and the entire 
      staff at MAX Technical Training, we became full-stack developers ready for our first development
      jobs!

      The Dev Jammers have worked hard these past few months, we came in early for help and stayed 
      late after class to work on projects. We have taught each other, learned from each other, 
      and helped each other out. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We are a class full of researchers, veterans, engineers, graphic designers, salesmen, and retail
      and restaurant workers. Somehow we were able to get along and work together!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All of Dev Jam is trained was trained in Scrum by Chuck Suscheck. A few of us have
      passed out Scrum test and are Scrum masters.

       Lisa Slutsky has prepared us for our job interviews over the course of the bootcamp.
       She has worked very hard to make sure we will all succeed and get placed as soon as 
       possible. A few of us have already found jobs at Ascendum Solutions and Kroger.

<h2>About Me!</h2>
<div class = "wrapper">
  <img src = "img/profilepic.jpg" alt = "my picture" class = "pic1">
  <p>
    I was born in Cincinnati, OH and grew up here. I went to grade school at Indian Hill and graduated 
    from high school in 2010. I moved to Boulder, CO after high school to study chemical engineering
    at the University of Colorado. I graduated with a bachelor of science in chemical engineering 
    and a certificate in Spanish in 2014. Since then, I've been working for in Mathematica making 
    interactive simulations. In August 2018 I started attending a Java bootcamp ant MAX Technical 
    Training/Cincy Code IT.

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    In August 2018 I started a Java bootcamp at MAX Technical Training/Cincy Code IT. THe bootcamp ran 
    August to November and I learned how to become a full-stack developer. My capstone project was a
    single-page purchase request system. It was made using Java, Spring framework, MySQL, Angular 
    framework, CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<div class = "wrapper">
  <img src = "img/margules.jpg" alt = "mathematica" class = "pic2">
  <p>
    From 2013 to 2018 I used Mathematica to create interactive simulations on diferent topics
    in chemical and mechanical engineering that are published to the 
    <a href = "http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/author.html?author=Rachael%20L.%20Baumann">
      Wolfram Demonstrations Project</a>
    website. I have been the main coder on the project for 5 years. I worked closely with a professor
    at the University of Colrado Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering to supplement
    the 
    <a href = "http://learncheme.com">LearnChemE</a>
    youtube project.
    <br/>
    The simulation on the right is a pressure-composition plot for a non-ideal binary mixture that 
    is in vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) modeled using the Margules equation. You can change the 
    Margules parameters, change the deviation from Raoult's law, and view either a P-x-y or a 
    T-x-y diagram.
